# Todowarrior

Todowarrior is a CLI task manager that uses the ical format for tasks, similar to Todoman. At the same time, Todowarrior's command line interface is similar to the one from Taskwarrior. As a consequence, Todowarrior lets you work with your tasks with similar efficiency as Taskwarrior does while at the same time lets you profit from the many applications supporting ical-based task management. For example, you can synchronize your tasks with Nextcloud or Radicale and manage your tasks on Android using OpenTasks or Tasks.org.
